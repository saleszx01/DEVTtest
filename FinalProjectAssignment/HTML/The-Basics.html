    <section>
      <h2 class="centered">How Sound Is Produced</h2>
      <p class="content-bg">To produce sound on a guitar, you need to press one of the strings with your fingertip against the guitar neck, on the metal divider. 
        Then, you play that string with your other hand, either using your fingers or a pick.</p>
      <p class="content-bg">The closer the fret you press is to the guitar body, the higher the pitch of the sound. The farther away, the lower the pitch.</p>

        <article class="content-bg">
          <p>The guitar has 6 strings, from the thickest (lowest pitch) to the thinnest (highest pitch):</p>
          <ol>
            <li>6th string (thickest): low E note</li>
            <li>5th string: A note</li>
            <li>4th string: D note</li>
            <li>3rd string: G note</li>
            <li>2nd string: B note</li>
            <li>1st string (thinnest): high E note</li>
          </ol>
          <p>When you press a string on a fret, you change the note played. For example: in tablature, 42 means 4th string, 2nd fret.</p>

    <!-- Section: What Are Chords -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="centered">What Chords Are and How to Play Them</h2>
      <p class="content-bg">A chord is formed when you play three or more notes at the same time. This happens by pressing several strings in specific positions and playing them together.</p>

      <div class="basics-grid">
        <article class="content-bg">
          <p><strong>C major</strong>: press the 5th string on the 3rd fret, the 4th string on the 2nd fret, and the 2nd string on the 1st fret.</p>

      <p class="centered content-bg">Play all these strings at the same time to hear the chord sound. At first, your fingers may hurt a little, but this improves with practice.</p>
